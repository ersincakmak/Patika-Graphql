You can reach out this homework on [this link.](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/graphql/project-04)

This project has no demo link, because I combined the whole project into one repository and couldn't deploy the server.

## Client Installation 

You need to create an .env file on the root directory of the client and fill it like below

```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT={{if you use server on this project you can type http://localhost:4000/graphql}}
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_URL={{if you use server on this project you can type ws://localhost:4000/graphql}}
```

and you can run this script *npm install && npm run start* and you can reach out the client on localhost:3000

## Server Installation 

You can just start this script *npm install && npm run start* and you can reach out the api on localhost:4000/graphql
