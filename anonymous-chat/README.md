You can reach out this homework on [this link.](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/graphql/project-03)

This project has no demo link, because I combined the whole project into one repository and couldn't deploy the server.

## Client Installation 

You need to create an .env file on the root directory of the client and fill it like below

```.env
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_SUBSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT=
```

and you can run this script *npm install && npm run start*

## Server Installation 

You need to create an .env file on the root directory of the server and fill it like below

```.env
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

and you can run this script *npm install && npm run start*
