# Homework 3

This homework [link](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/graphql/odev-03).

This project has no demo link, because I combined the whole project into one repository and couldn't deploy the server.

## Installation

You need to go to project directory and run this command

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

after that you can react the graphql server on http:/localhost:4000/graphql
