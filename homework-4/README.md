# Homework 4

This homework [link](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/graphql/odev-04).

This project has no demo link, because I combined the whole project into one repository and couldn't deploy the server.

## Installation

You need to start server and client individually. First go to server directory and run this command
```
yarn && yarn dev
```
after that go to client directory and run this command
```
yarn && yarn start
```

Finally you can reach out the server on 
```
http:/localhost:4000/graphql
```
and client on 
```
http:/localhost:3000
```
